3. GPT-4o-mini generates 3 ICPs
   ↓
4. User selects target ICP (card click)
   ↓
5. GPT-4o-mini generates landing page
   ↓
6. User previews & publishes
   ↓
7. Unique URL created (e.g., /p/abc123)
   ↓
8. Leads submit form → Supabase

## 🔧 Customization Points

### 1. Change Number of ICPs
Edit `src/app/api/generate-icps/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Change from 3 to 5 ICPs
content: `Generate 5 ICPs in JSON format.`
```

### 2. Modify ICP Structure
Edit the system prompt in `generate-icps/route.ts`:
```typescript
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "...",
  "industry": "...",      // Add new field
  "budget": "...",        // Add new field
  "painPoints": [...],
  "goals": [...]
}
```

### 3. Customize Landing Page Sections
Edit `src/app/page.tsx` preview section to add:
- Testimonials
- Pricing table
- Feature comparison
- FAQ section
- Trust badges

### 4. Change AI Model
Edit any API route:
```typescript
model: "gpt-4o-mini", // Change to "gpt-4o" for better quality
```

### 5. Add Analytics
Install Vercel Analytics:
```bash
npm install @vercel/analytics
```

## 💰 Monetization Ideas

1. **Freemium**: 3 free pages, then $29/mo for unlimited
2. **Per-Page**: $9 per published page
3. **Agency**: $99/mo for teams + white-label
4. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for API access
5. **Templates**: Sell pre-made ICP templates

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Jina AI Rate Limits**: May fail on high traffic (add Firecrawl fallback)
2. **No Authentication**: Anyone can use the app (add Supabase Auth)
3. **No Draft Saving**: Can't save work in progress (easy to add)
4. **Basic Analytics**: No cohort/funnel analysis (future feature)
5. **No Editing After Publish**: Can't modify published pages (add in v0.2)
